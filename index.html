          Kyojuro was greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira,
          and often came across as cheerfully eccentric. He was amiable, pure of
          heart, and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming
          from strict practice and discipline. He was an honorable warrior who
          adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into
          him by his mother at a young age—the most significant being his belief
          that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.

          As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Kyojuro was a very powerful
          and skilled combatant. Before he took his father's place, Kyojuro was
          already shown to be an amazing fighter. He successfully avenged the
          death of the 9 Demon Slayers that died to the Flute Demon by himself
          and later managed to singlehandedly defeat Lower Rank Two, Hairo, who
          even appraised his swordsmanship before he died. Moreover, his father,
          Shinjuro Rengoku, stated that, after he stopped teaching his son,
          Kyojuro trained himself to become a Hashira by learning from the guide
          book of the Flame Breathing style, a book which only had three
          volumes.

          As he was a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Kyojuro was one of the
          most powerful and skilled swordsmen in the entire organization.
          Additionally, Kyojuro is part of the Rengoku family which has an
          impressive lineage of powerful swordsmen and Flame Hashira, giving
          Kyojuro an edge in developing and polishing his swordsmanship. His
          extraordinary swordsmanship skill has been displayed on multiple
          occasions across the series.
